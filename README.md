## 🤔 What's this project?
This was supposed to be my diploma, but i changed the diploma topic<br>
This is a minesweeper game that was supposed to have a multiplayer up to 8 players and various modes<br>
It's probably halfway done, but i'm too lazy to finish it<br>
It already has some kind of leveling system, local accounts and ability to play<br>
Without an ending screen tho<br>

## 💻 What tech stack is used?
Front-end: NextJS, Sass, styled-components<br>
Back-end: Tauri<br>
State management: context-api <br>

## ✏️ How it looks like?
